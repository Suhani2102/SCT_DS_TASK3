üß† Task 3: Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction

Task Objective:
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used for this task is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

üìå Problem Statement
The goal is to develop a classification model that can predict customer response (yes or no) to a marketing campaign for a term deposit based on various customer features such as age, job, marital status, education, contact method, campaign history, etc.

üóÉÔ∏è Dataset Description
‚Ä¢Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

‚Ä¢File Used: bank-full.csv

‚Ä¢Target Variable: y ‚Äì whether the client subscribed to a term deposit

‚Ä¢Type of Data: Demographic and behavioral features from marketing campaigns

Key Features:

‚Ä¢age, job, marital, education, default, balance, housing, loan

‚Ä¢contact, day, month, duration, campaign, pdays, previous, poutcome

üß™ Steps Performed

1.Data Preparation

‚Ä¢Loaded the dataset from bank-full.csv

‚Ä¢Explored the structure, checked data types, and verified missing values

‚Ä¢Label encoded the target variable (y)

‚Ä¢Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables

2.Exploratory Data Analysis

‚Ä¢Visualized class distribution using bar charts

‚Ä¢Analyzed correlation between numerical variables

3.Model Building

‚Ä¢Trained multiple decision tree models using DecisionTreeClassifier:

‚Ä¢A default decision tree

‚Ä¢A pruned tree with constraints (max_depth, min_samples_leaf)

‚Ä¢A model excluding the duration column (to simulate real-time prediction use-case)

4.Model Evaluation

‚Ä¢Evaluated models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

‚Ä¢Compared model performance on training vs. test sets

‚Ä¢Visualized decision trees using plot_tree() from sklearn.tree

üìä Key Insights for Data Analysts

‚Ä¢The target variable (y) is highly imbalanced (majority "no" responses).

‚Ä¢Features like poutcome, previous, and contact played a significant role in prediction.

‚Ä¢Removing duration slightly impacted performance, confirming it's a post-call outcome and not useful for real-time prediction.

‚Ä¢Pruned decision trees offer a better generalization compared to fully grown ones.

üìö Libraries & Tools Used

‚Ä¢Python

‚Ä¢Pandas, NumPy

‚Ä¢Matplotlib, Seaborn

‚Ä¢Scikit-learn

‚úÖ Outcome

Successfully built interpretable decision tree models that classify customer responses to marketing campaigns. The task demonstrated how customer data can be used to support decision-making in targeting strategies.
